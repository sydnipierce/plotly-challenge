This repository contains files for a webpage displaying belly button bacteria for multiple individuals in a sample set. Select the individual's ID you wish to view in the drop-down menu on the left, and two charts will populate with belly button bacteria data for that individual:

1. "Top 10 OTUs Present" bar chart - Shows the top ten OTUs present in the selected individual as well as the microbe value for each.
2. "All OTUs Present" bubble chart - Shows all OTUs present in the selected individual as well as the microbe value for each (on the y axis, plus represented by bubble radius).
